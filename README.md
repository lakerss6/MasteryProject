# MasteryProject

This is a project I have created, what it is, a place for students, to use to help them gain a internship, for instance we have created Place to apply, What to prepare for, and Also a job application tracker helping you track your aplications.

The main sections of the site are, A place to apply, What to prepare for and also a Application tracker.

This project focuses on using HTML and CSS to build a clear layout and a easy to understand and maybe even expand on in the future.
